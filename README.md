# Transcripta
This is a project we made and submitted for our IDC409- Intro to DS and AI course. 

## Speech-to-Text and it's Applications

## Overview
This includes all the details of the project we have created for our **IDC409: Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** course. The assignment was to take an audio file, transcribe its contents into text, and optionally use this text for further processing or text-to-speech synthesis. We developed a speech-to-text (STT) system utilising the `faster-whisper` library, which leverages OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model.

This repository contains the **speech-to-text extraction module**, the first major step in the workflow.  
In addition to this core code, our project extends this skeleton into three advanced modules:
- **Multilingual Transcription and Language Detection:** automatically detecting and transcribing audio in multiple languages.  
- **Live Speech-to-Text Transcription:** enabling real-time transcription from microphone input.  
- **Model Comparison Framework:** comparing the accuracy and performance of different speech-to-text models.

These extensions demonstrate practical applications of speech recognition systems and explore how model choice, noise level and language diversity influence transcription accuracy.

---

### How It Works

The system utilises a **Whisper model** to transcribe a given audio file into text.  
The transcription process includes:
- Loading the Whisper model
- Reading the input audio file (like `.mp3` or `.wav`)
- Detecting language and generating text segments
- Printing and saving the transcribed text to a `.txt` file

The main idea is to provide an accurate and efficient transcription pipeline that can be easily integrated into larger AI/ML workflows.

---

### Code Explanation 

Below is an explanation of the script's main components.

```python
from faster_whisper import WhisperModel
import os, sys, datetime
```
Imports libraries:
- `faster_whisper` loads and runs the Whisper model
- `os, sys` handle file paths and command-line arguments
- `datetime` is used to timestamp transcript creation

```python
model_size = "small.en"
model = WhisperModel(model_size, device="cpu", compute_type="float32")
```
- Defines the Whisper model variant (`small.en` = English-only and efficient)
- Loads the model on CPU with 32-bit precision, suitable for local systems without GPU

```python
audio_arg = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "audio.mp3"
```
- Allows the script to accept an audio file path as a command-line argument
- If no argument is provided, it defaults to `"audio.mp3"` in the same directory

```python
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
audio_path = audio_arg if os.path.isabs(audio_arg) else os.path.join(script_dir, audio_arg)
```
- This resolves absolute path of the audio file
- Ensures the file is correctly located relative to where the script is executed

```python
if not os.path.exists(audio_path):
    sys.exit(f"Audio file not found: {audio_path} ...")
```
- Performs the core transcription
- `segments` contain transcribed text chunks
- `info` holds metadata like detected language and confidence score
- `beam_size=5` improves accuracy by using beam search decoding

```python
print("Detected language '%s' with probability %f" % (info.language, info.language_probability))
```
- Displays detected language and confidence, useful for multilingual datasets

```python
transcript_lines = []
for segment in segments:
    print(segment.text)
    transcript_lines.append(segment.text)
```
- Iterates through all transcription segments, printing them to the console
- Stores each segment in a list for writing to a file later

```python
base = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(audio_path))[0]
out_name = f"{base}_transcript.txt"
out_path = os.path.join(script_dir, out_name)
```
- Creates a new text file name based on the original audio name.\
Like: `audio.mp3` to `audio_transcript.txt`

```python
with open(out_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(f"Source: {audio_path}\n")
    f.write(f"Model: {model_size}\n")
    f.write(f"Detected language: {info.language} (probability={info.language_probability})\n")
    f.write(f"Created: {datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()}\n\n")
    for line in transcript_lines:
        f.write(line.strip() + "\n")
```
- Writes metadata (source file, model, date) and transcription text to the output file
- UTF-8 encoding ensures compatibility with all characters

```python
print(f"Transcript saved to: {out_path}")
```
- Prints the output file location for user

---

### Running the Code 
1. Install libraries/ modules:
```bash
pip install faster-whisper
```
2. Place Your Audio File\
Save your audio file (like `audio.mp3`) in the same directory as the script/ note its full path.
3. Run the Script
You can run the script in two ways:
- Default audio file (`audio.mp3`)
```bash
python3 speech_to_text.py
```
- Custom audio file path
```bash
python3 speech_to_text.py /path/to/your_audio.mp3
```
---

### Transcription Workflow
This is the step-by-step process this project uses to convert audio into accurate text, multilingually.

**Importing Libraries**\
Essential Python modules are loaded to handle system operations, file management, audio processing, GUI interaction, and the Whisper transcription model. Each module serves a specific purpose to support the end-to-end workflow.

:arrow_down:

**Model Configuration**\
The Whisper model is configured with parameters that balance speed and accuracy. Device selection and numerical precision are defined to ensure reliable transcription across different systems.

:arrow_down:

**Audio Conversion**\
Audio files are standardised to an optimal format for transcription. This includes converting to a single-channel WAV file, adjusting sample rates, and normalising audio levels. Temporary files are handled safely to prevent data loss.

:arrow_down:

**Transcription**\
Audio samples are passed through the Whisper model with parameters designed to maintain context and produce high-quality text. The transcription captures timestamps for words and detects the language automatically, with confidence scoring.

:arrow_down:

**File Management and Output**\
Each audio file is transcribed into a separate text file that includes metadata such as source, model, detected language, confidence, and timestamp. All individual transcripts are also aggregated into a CSV file for easy analysis and reporting.

:arrow_down:

**Graphical File Selection**\
A user-friendly GUI allows multiple audio files to be selected without requiring command-line input, simplifying the workflow for end users.

---

### **Importing Libraries**

We start by importing essential modules for system operations, audio handling, GUI, and the transcription model:

```python

import os
import sys
import datetime
import tempfile
import subprocess
import shutil
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
from faster_whisper import WhisperModel
import soundfile as sf
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Each module serves a precise role, from file management (os, shutil) to data handling (pandas) and transcription (faster-whisper).

---

### Model Configuration  

```python

model_size = "medium"
device = "cpu"
compute_type = "float32"
output_csv = "results.csv"
```
- `model_size` balances speed and accuracy.
- `device` ensures compatibility (CPU used here).
- `compute_type` ensures numerical precision.
- `output_csv` sets the default CSV file name.

### Script Directory Reference
```python
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
```
We store outputs in the same directory as the script, ensuring paths are consistent across systems.

### Audio Conversion
Before transcription, audio files are converted to a standardised `.wav` format for optimal processing:

```python

def _convert_with_ffmpeg(src_path):
    if shutil.which("ffmpeg") is None:
        raise RuntimeError("ffmpeg not found. Install it with: brew install ffmpeg")
   
    tmp = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=".wav", delete=False)
    tmp.close()
    out_path = tmp.name
   
    cmd = [
        "ffmpeg", "-y",
        "-i", src_path,
        "-ar", "16000",
        "-ac", "1",
        "-af", "loudnorm=I=-16:TP=-1.5:LRA=11",
        out_path
    ]
   
    res = subprocess.run(cmd, stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    if res.returncode != 0 or not os.path.exists(out_path):
        try: os.remove(out_path)
        except Exception: pass
        raise RuntimeError("ffmpeg conversion failed for: " + src_path)
    return out_path
```
Errors are handled cleanly to prevent partial transcription or corrupted files.

### Transcription Function
```python
def transcribe_audio(audio_path, model):
    use_tmp = None
    try:
        use_tmp = _convert_with_ffmpeg(audio_path)
        samples, rate = sf.read(use_tmp, dtype="float32")
        segments, info = model.transcribe(
            samples,
            beam_size=5,
            word_timestamps=True,
            condition_on_previous_text=True,
            temperature=0.0,
            compression_ratio_threshold=2.4,
            no_speech_threshold=0.6,
            initial_prompt="The following is a high-quality transcription:"
        )
        transcript = " ".join([seg.text.strip() for seg in segments]).strip()
        return info.language, info.language_probability, transcript
    finally:
        if use_tmp:
            try: os.remove(use_tmp)
            except Exception: pass
```

### GUI Audio Picker

```python

def pick_audio_files():
    filetypes = [("Audio files", "*.mp3 *.wav *.m4a *.flac *.ogg *.aac"), ("All files", "*.*")]
    root = tk.Tk()
    root.withdraw()
    selected = filedialog.askopenfilenames(title="Select one or more audio files", initialdir=script_dir, filetypes=filetypes)
    root.update()
    root.destroy()
    return list(selected)
```


A graphical interface makes it easy to select multiple audio files without relying on the command line.

### Saving Transcripts and CSV

```python

base = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(audio_arg))[0]
out_txt = os.path.join(script_dir, f"{base}_transcript.txt")
with open(out_txt, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(f"Source: {audio_arg}\n")
    f.write(f"Model: {model_size}\n")
    f.write(f"Language: {lang} (confidence: {prob})\n")
    f.write(f"Created: {datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()}\n\n")
    f.write(transcript)

rows.append({"File": os.path.basename(audio_arg), "Language": lang, "Confidence": prob, "Transcript": transcript})
df = pd.DataFrame(rows)
csv_path = os.path.join(script_dir, output_csv)
df.to_csv(csv_path, index=False)
```
All transcripts are aggregated into a `.csv` file, providing a complete dataset for analysis or reporting.

---

### Output

The transcription workflow delivers results in two complementary formats:

1. **Individual Transcript Files:**
- Each audio file produces a separate `.txt` file.
- Metadata: source filename, Whisper model version, detected language with confidence score, and timestamp.
- Provides the full, readable transcript for easy review.

2. **Aggregated CSV:**
- Compiles all transcripts into a single `.csv` file.
- Each row records the filename, language, confidence, and complete transcript.

## Extension 2: Live Speech-to-Text Transcription

This extension builds upon our base STT model by enabling **real-time transcription** of spoken input through a computerâ€™s microphone.  
It continuously listens, detects active speech segments, and transcribes them into text, all without needing an audio file input.

### Key Idea

While the base code processes pre-recorded audio files, this script introduces a **live audio stream**.
The model captures sound data in small chunks, processes them through **voice activity detection (VAD)**, and runs transcription using `faster-whisper`.

This is especially useful for applications such as:
- Live meeting transcription
- Real-time captioning
- Voice command systems

### Components and Their Purpose

#### 1. Audio Input Stream
```python
import sounddevice as sd
samplerate = 16000
block_duration = 0.25
chunk_duration = 4.0 
channels = 1
```
The `sounddevice` library is used to capture live audio from the systemâ€™s microphone.\
The audio is recorded in small blocks (0.25 seconds each), which are queued for processing. We take longer chunks for better context.

#### 2. Queue and Threading 
```python
audio_queue = queue.Queue()
rec_thread = threading.Thread(target=recorder, daemon=True)
trans_thread = threading.Thread(target=transcriber, daemon=True)
```
Two threads run simultaneously:\
- **Recorder thread:** Listens to the microphone and pushes raw audio blocks into a queue
- **Transcriber thread:** Continuously consumes from the queue, processes speech, and generates transcriptions.\
This prevents blocking and ensures a continuous transcription.

#### 3. Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
```python
vad_threshold = 0.005 
class VAD:
    def is_speech(self, audio_data, base_threshold=0.005):
        energy = np.sqrt(np.mean(audio_data ** 2))
        ...
        return energy > dynamic_threshold
```
VAD only processes spoken audio, not silence or background noise.\
A dynamic threshold is used to adapt to varying ambient noise levels, improving accuracy and efficiency.

#### 4. Handling Overlaps
```python
overlap_duration = 0.85
context_buffer = []
context_size = 3
```
To maintain context and continuity between chunks, each new transcription chunk overlaps slightly with the previous one.\
The `context_buffer` ensures no text is duplicated and helps smooth out sentence boundaries.

#### 5. Filtering Similarities
```python
def similarity_score(text1, text2):
    words1 = set(text1.lower().split())
    ...
    return len(intersection) / shorter
```
This function prevents repeated phrases from being printed multiple times.\
If a new segment is too similar to recent ones, itâ€™s skipped.

#### 6. Live Transcription Loop
```python
segments, _ = model.transcribe(
    chunk_mono,
    language="en",
    beam_size=5,
    condition_on_previous_text=False,
    vad_filter=True
)
```
Each 4-second chunk of speech is transcribed using the Whisper model.\
Parameters like `beam_size=5` control decoding accuracy, while `vad_filter=True` improves word boundary detection.

7. Output
```python
if transcript_lines:
    out_name = f"transcript_{datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}.txt"
```
All transcriptions are stored in a timestamped text file once the recording stops.\

---

### Running the Script
1. Dependencies:
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
```bash
pip install sounddevice numpy faster-whisper
```
2. To start live transcription, run:
```bash
python3 live_transcriber.py
```
3. Then speak into your microphone, the script will:
- Continuously listen to your voice.
- Transcribe what you say in real-time.
- Save the full transcript to a `.txt` file when stopped.\
Press **Enter** or **Ctrl+C** to stop recording.

## Extension 3: Speech Recognition Model Comparison Tool

### Overview

This module expands our project into a **comparative analysis tool** for evaluating multiple STT models on the same audio samples.  
It automatically benchmarks **Whisper**, **Vosk**, and **Google Speech Recognition**, comparing their:
- **Transcription accuracy** (WER, CER, Sentence & Punctuation Accuracy)
- **Speed and efficiency** (Real-Time Factor, RAM usage)
- **Noise robustness**
- **Overall performance through plots and tables**

A **GUI file selector** makes it simple to choose audio and reference transcript files, while automated plots and tables visualise performance across all models.

### Key Idea

Each STT engine uses a different architecture:
- **Whisper** | OpenAI | High accuracy, multilingual, robust 
- **Vosk** | Kaldi | Lightweight, offline, fast 
- **Google Speech Recognition** | Cloud API | High-quality but dependent on internet 

This script creates a **uniform evaluation pipeline:**
1. Converts and normalises audio files.  
2. Adds controlled background noise.  
3. Transcribes audio using all three models.  
4. Calculates multiple accuracy metrics.  
5. Plots and summarises results.

### Components and Explanations

#### 1. **Workspace Setup and Model Initialisation**
```python
workspace_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"), "speech_compare_workspace")
whisper_model = WhisperModel("small.en", device="cpu", compute_type="float32")
```
All results (plots, CSVs, and transcripts) are organised under a single workspace folder.\
The Whisper model is loaded once for efficiency.

#### 2. File Selection (GUI)
```python
from tkinter import filedialog
audio_files = filedialog.askopenfilenames(title="Select Audio Files")
```
A **Tkinter file** dialogue allows users to pick multiple audio and transcript files interactively, making the process beginner-friendly and avoiding manual path entry.

#### 3. Vosk Model Setup
```python
download_and_extract_vosk(vosk_zip_url, vosk_zip_path, workspace_dir)
vosk_model = VoskModel(vosk_dir)
```
If the Vosk model isnâ€™t available, itâ€™s automatically downloaded and extracted.\
Ensuring the script can run on any machine with internet access and no prior setup.

#### 4. Audio Preprocessing
```python
def convert_to_wav(src_path):
    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(src_path)
    audio = audio.set_channels(1).set_frame_rate(16000)
```
Every file is standardised to mono **16 kHz WAV**, the preferred format for most STT models for fair comparison and consistent sampling rates.

#### 5. Noise Augmentation
```python
def add_noise(audio_path, snr_db=noise_level_db):
    noise = WhiteNoise().to_audio_segment(duration=len(audio))
    noisy = audio.overlay(noise)
```
Controlled background noise is added to simulate real-world recording conditions.\
The `snr_db` value determines 'how loud the noise is relative' to the voice.

#### 6. Performance Measurement
```python
def measure_performance(func, *args):
    start = time.time()
    result = func(*args)
    end = time.time()
    return result, {"time_sec": end - start, "ram_mb": ram_end - ram_start}
```
Tracks execution time and RAM consumption for each transcription.\
This helps compare how efficiently each model runs under similar workloads.

#### 7. Metric Computation
```python
from jiwer import wer, cer
metrics['WER'] = wer(ref_norm, pred_norm)
metrics['CER'] = cer(ref_norm, pred_norm)
```
Four key accuracy metrics are computed:
- **WER (Word Error Rate)** measures word-level mistakes.
- **CER (Character Error Rate)** measures finer differences.
- **Sentence Accuracy** how many full sentences are transcribed correctly.
- **Punctuation Accuracy** evaluates preservation of punctuation marks.
Lower WER/CER and higher accuracy scores indicate better performance.

#### 8. Transcription Functions
Each model is wrapped in a separate transcription function:
```python
def transcribe_whisper(path): ...
def transcribe_vosk(path, model): ...
def transcribe_google(path): ...
```
This modular structure allows easy addition of future models (e.g., DeepSpeech or OpenAI Whisper large).

#### 9. Real-Time Factor (RTF)
```python
def compute_rtf(duration_sec, processing_time):
    return processing_time / duration_sec
```
RTF = 1: model processes at real-time speed
RTF < 1: faster than real-time (ideal)
RTF > 1: slower than real-time

#### 10. Data Aggregation and Visualisation
```python
df.to_csv(results_csv_path, index=False)
plot_results(df)
create_metrics_table(df)
```
After all transcriptions, results are saved to CSV and visualised using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Example visualisations include:
- WER/CER bar charts
- Accuracy plots
- RTF comparisons
All plots are automatically stored in the `plots/` folder.

---

### Running the Script
1. Dependencies:
```bash
pip install faster-whisper vosk speechrecognition pydub jiwer psutil seaborn pandas matplotlib certifi
```
2. To launch the comparison tool:
```bash
python3 compare_models.py
```
Steps:
- Select multiple audio files (like, `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.flac`)
- Wait while each STT model transcribes the audio
- Review the printed performance tables, CSVs, and plots
